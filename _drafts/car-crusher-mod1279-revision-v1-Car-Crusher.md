Car Crusher (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ an arcade time-killer with elements of physics whose developers used a rather unusual idea as a game mechanic. And so, you have to control a hydraulic press to destroy various vehicles from cars to airplanes. Perhaps, at first glance, the gameplay may seem monotonous, but realistic physics, detailed graphics and a well-developed damage model will give the process of realism and originality. In addition, you will be able to examine in detail the process of destruction and set up a kind of experiment.
