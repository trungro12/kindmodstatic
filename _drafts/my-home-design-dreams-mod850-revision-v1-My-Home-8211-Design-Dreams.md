My Home – Design Dreams (MOD, Unlimited Money) – an exciting puzzle from a series of three in a row whose creators decided to somewhat diversify the familiar gameplay using the elements of the interior designer’s simulator. And so, you have to go through the levels of combining identical elements of three in a row and more, thereby opening up various elements of decor, furniture, ready-made interiors, and then applying all this when arranging apartments and houses. It is worth noting that you are waiting for more than a hundred levels, a huge selection of buildings, as well as a separate storyline.
