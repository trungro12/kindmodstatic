Royal Revolt 2 – sequel to the popular tactical strategy from the tower defense series, whose creators have decided to give the gameplay from a different angle, so you have to do not at all to defend, but just the opposite to capture the enemy’s citadels. In turn, the sequel kept the original mechanics, but got a number of upgrades, improved graphics, new units and locations, and of course a completely new story. It is also worth noting the presence of full multiplayer, which allows you to play together with your friends.
