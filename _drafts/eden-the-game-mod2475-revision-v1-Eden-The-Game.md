Eden: The Game (MOD, unlimited money) â€“ An interesting construction strategy that will test all your skills. All you need is to build your own camp and attract residents as much as possible. Build houses and other necessary structures. Get resources for survival such as water, food, firewood, and much more. And as you progress through the game, turn your camp into a small town. The game is similar to the mechanics of the game at all known SimCity. All fans of building games will love it!
