Parkour Race (MOD, Unlocked) â€“ arcade time-killer with elements of the parkour simulator and runner. Your task will be to move from building to building to get to the finish line, while you can not only make intricate somersaults and jumps, but jogs in vertical surfaces, walls, and more. We should also pay attention to the fact that the races will be held in the group, so you have to use all your skills to get to the finish line first. Stylish minimalist graphics and simple controls allow you to fully concentrate on the gameplay.
