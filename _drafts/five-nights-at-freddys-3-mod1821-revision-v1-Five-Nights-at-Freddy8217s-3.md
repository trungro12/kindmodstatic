Five Nights at Freddy’s 3 (MOD, Unlocked) – one of the most popular horror projects that initially went on the PC and won deserved recognition among gamers and as a result debuted on mobile platforms with no less success. And here we have the third part of the franchise, the events of which develop thirty years after what happened in the first part. And so, the creators of the project decided to recreate the story while paying more attention to realism and detail. In turn, the game itself also received a number of updates, including the continuation of the plot, new levels and improved graphics.
