Going Balls (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ is a dynamic game in which players have to guide a bouncing ball through a series of dangerous obstacles and levels. You must control the movement of the ball, jump over obstacles and avoid traps as you move through each level and make your way to the finish line. The game is unique in its innovative control system, which uses a one-touch algorithm to move the ball left and right and accurately jump over obstacles. You must watch your movements closely and react quickly to avoid traps and hazards, making each level an exciting challenge. As you progress through the game, you will encounter different environments, from a fiery inferno to an icy tundra, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles to overcome.
