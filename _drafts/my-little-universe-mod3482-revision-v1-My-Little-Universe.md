My Little Universe (MOD, Unlimited Resources) â€“ a game in which you can feel like God and build your own planet. Pick up a pickaxe or an axe and collect useful materials, but to build new islands you will need not only wood and stones, but also many different fossil metals. As you build new cities, you can open businesses and repopulate empty islands. Keep your planet safe from enemies who will regularly attack civilians.
