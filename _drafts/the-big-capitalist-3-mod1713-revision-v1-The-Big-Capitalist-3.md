The Big Capitalist 3 (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ economic simulator with elements of real-time strategy and an arcade clicker in which you have to try to increase the capital of the main character, while you first need to earn start-up capital. After your condition increases, you will have the opportunity to invest part of the funds in one of the profitable projects, but you should be careful. Despite the fact that the game is made in an arcade style, a well-developed economic model and ample opportunities for using funds will give The Big Capitalist 3 a certain realism.
