But the bloodthirsty monster is not your only problem, tangled mazes, dark cellars, traps, intricate quests and tasks will make your life even more difficult. In the end you will need to get out of this horror, and even try to solve the main mystery of the park. The stylized graphics and corresponding soundtrack perfectly convey the atmosphere of horror and despair.
