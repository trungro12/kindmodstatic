Return to Planet X â€“ single-player first person shooter with a fantastic storyline. And so, according to the idea you have to go to the planet X and try to get through a secret laboratory that literally teems with beetles, monsters and mutants. In general, the gameplay is made in the classic style for the genre, run, destroy enemies, collect improvements. Separately, it is worth noting the excellent three-dimensional graphics and well-designed control, as well as a fantastic atmosphere.
