Orbia: Tap and Relax (MOD, Unlimited Crystal) â€“ an exciting arcade time-killer in which your task with tapes to control the movement of the protagonist, while controlling the direction and strength of the flight must send the character into a rotating circle, which, incidentally, is surrounded by monsters from all sides, so you need to be extremely careful. Uncomplicated gameplay is perfectly complemented by stylish minimalistic graphics, perky soundtrack and a variety of content.
