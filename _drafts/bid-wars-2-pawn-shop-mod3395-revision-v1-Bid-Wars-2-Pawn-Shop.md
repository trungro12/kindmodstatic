Bid Wars: Pawn Empire (MOD, Unlimited Money) – quite an interesting economic simulator in which you have to bid for storage cells, but it’s worth remembering that you don’t know what is in the storage and only at the end of the process you can look into the cell. And after that you will have the opportunity to sell everything that you have acquired. Of course, it is important not to miscalculate the price. In addition, you can note nice hand-drawn graphics and elaborate detailed objects.
