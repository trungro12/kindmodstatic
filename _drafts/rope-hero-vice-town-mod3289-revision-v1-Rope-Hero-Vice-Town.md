Rope Hero: Vice Town (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ dynamic three-dimensional action with a third person. The game begins to evolve from the moment your hero wakes up on the street dressed in a superhero costume, and from the weapons he has only a strange kind of rope. Realizing that you can find out what happened only by following in your footsteps you set off on a journey through the city, while completing various tasks and missions, as well as destroying enemies. As you progress, you will be pumping your character, and completing quests you will use not only lasso, but also vehicles.
