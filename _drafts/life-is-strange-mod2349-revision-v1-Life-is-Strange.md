Life is Strange (MOD, Unlocked) â€“ game project from the top developer of the studio SQUARE ENIX. This time the studio which has established itself as the developer of the best rolevok has decided to change the approach somewhat and to please us with a visual history, which quite successfully integrated elements of the RPG, text game and even action. The whole game is divided into several stories in each of which you have to play the role of the next character, with each story requiring you a new approach and a look at the passage. Visually Life is Strange is simply amazing and will undoubtedly please all fans of realistic graphics.
