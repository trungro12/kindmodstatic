Granny: Chapter Two (MOD, Monster Not Attack) – the second part of the popular horror quest, the creators of which used a rather unusual mechanics. And so, in the sequel, you were again locked in the house, but unlike the background, this time your grandmother and grandfather will hunt you, while an elderly man does not differ in excellent hearing, but he will be able to cripple you, but your grandmother will even hear a rustle. As it’s not difficult to guess, your main task will be to get out of the house while trying not only not to catch the eye of an insidious couple, but also keeping silence.
