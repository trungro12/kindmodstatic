Space Shooter – Galaxy Attack (MOD, Unlimited Money) – is an impressive and exciting space scrolling shooter where you take on the role of defending Earth against invading alien ships. You have only one starship, but its arsenal will ensure not only the defeat of ordinary enemies, but also the effective confrontation of impressive bosses. It’s easy to fly your spaceship with a simple flick of the wrist: just point it in the right direction and your spaceship will fly. Your task is to control its direction, avoiding collisions with enemies and their projectiles. Each level offers different waves of enemies, varying in type and number. At the end of each level a boss battle awaits you, which will bring a new level of challenge and excitement. You’ll be able to improve both the strength of your weapons and other characteristics of your ship to effectively deal with increasingly difficult levels of the game.
