Resident Evil 2 Remake â€“ one of the most popular horror action games on gaming platforms, initially the project was released only on the PlayStation and only on the PC, unfortunately mobile devices were completely out of the way. However, now and then there are no official ports of such projects. So we have an Android version of the cult shooter that received the original name Resident Evil 2, and to create a mobile version, the developers used the Unreal Engine 4 game engine, which made it possible to perform the graphic part similar to the original. This port is not a complete analogue of the console version and has a simplified plot that does not hurt to enjoy the destruction of the undead by all fans of the series.
