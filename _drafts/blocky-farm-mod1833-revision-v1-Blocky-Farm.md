Blocky Farm (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ an unusual and original farm with elements of strategy and a town-planning simulator which is made in the popular pixel-cubic style. At the same time, the creators added RPG elements, which made it possible to add heroes and characters to an interaction with which the gameplay diversifies even more. In turn, you have to take care of planted crops, animals and other things, while using different types of equipment and other devices. A well-developed economic model will appeal to those who love all sorts of simulators.
