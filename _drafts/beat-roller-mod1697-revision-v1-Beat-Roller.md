Beat Roller (MOD, Unlimited Money) – classic musical rhythm arcade whose creators decided to add an unusual game feature. Unlike many analogs, you have to control the ball through constantly moving gates, and not jump on platforms like in most games of this genre. The rest of the Beat Roller is a vivid representative of the genre, colorful graphics, a “downhole” soundtrack and casual controls.
