Rocket League Sideswipe – a crazy soccer arcade game involving racing cars. Just like in normal soccer, you need to score the ball into the opponent’s goal, but in this game you need to do it with the help of a car. Physics and control in the game is very elaborate, movement is done with swipes to either side of the screen, and with taps you can jump and accelerate that will help you easily roll the ball to the gates of the enemy. Rocket League has already won fame on PC and consoles, and now you can play on your mobile device!
