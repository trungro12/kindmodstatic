Scary Neighbour (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ casual hide and seek with a lot of different levels in which you will have the opportunity to play a prank on your neighbor. To get started, enter the house of an evil neighbor, find tools and come up with a dirty trick or a trap, for example, breaking a switch, placing a mousetrap in a mailbox. Be vigilant that you are not seen, for this you can hide in the closet or activate invisibility. With each level it will be more difficult to implement the idea and remain unnoticed, but you will have many attempts to complete the game.
