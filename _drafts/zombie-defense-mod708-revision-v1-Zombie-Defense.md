Zombie Defense (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ action game gameplay is a kind of mix between real-time strategy and Tower Defense, and the combat system is made in the style of wall-to-wall battles. According to the storyline Gestapo synthesized some drugs that can turn soldiers into zombies just waiting to destroy everything on their way. You have to build groups of soldiers to organize the defense while using various upgrades, weapons, as well as your own handcrafted items. Ample opportunities for crafting, upgrading and development allow you to choose the best tactical scheme. Stylized graphics are in perfect harmony with the overall presentation of the game.
