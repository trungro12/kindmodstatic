Dino Bash (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ a very interesting arcade game that will take you many thousands of years ago, when the world was ruled by large and bloodthirsty dinosaurs, and there was no place for humanlike people. And so, your story begins just at the moment when dinosaurs inhabited our planet and were not going to leave for good, there was not much food, which means the tribes were starving, from that moment you start your amazing and at the same time dragging trip. Steal an egg in a prehistoric pangolin and try to run away with it to your cave, while the most important thing is to run there unharmed.
