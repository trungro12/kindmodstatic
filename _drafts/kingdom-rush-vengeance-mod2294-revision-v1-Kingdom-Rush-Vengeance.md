Kingdom Rush Vengeance (MOD, Unlimited Gems) â€“ continuation of fantasy tactical strategies from a series of defense towers. The first parts have gained immense popularity due to fabulous scenes, colorful hand-drawn graphics, original solutions in terms of locations, levels, characters, development system, storyline and others. This part received 16 new variants of the towers, a slightly modified pumping system, new enemies and a completely new storyline. In this case, the overall game mechanics has retained the familiar look.
