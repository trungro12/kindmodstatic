Zombie Squad (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ your city is completely empty, it seems to you that there is no hope, and then you hear by radio that there are survivors near the sea coast and you are not alone. Get there whole and unscathed and find the survivors, the game is amazing graphics and very beautiful special effects. Sit in your armored car and rush to the coast. On your way will be a lot of enemies who want to stop you and sit down, catch on your armored car a lot of guns, get to the point alive and watch the status of fuel in your car.
