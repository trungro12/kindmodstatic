Build a Bridge! (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ extremely exciting game that combines elements of an arcade, puzzle and building simulator. Although we have already seen more than one similar game, but this project is different with a number of interesting game features. So for a start, your task is to build a bridge across various gorges, rivers, and more. But unlike many analogs, the situation is such that in most cases there is not enough material for a full-fledged structure, so your task is to construct a structure with the help of which you can, for example, a long jump through the gorge. Realistic physics will add problems to you, but nice drawn graphics will add to the positive.
