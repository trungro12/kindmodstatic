Soap Cutting (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ a game that is quite difficult to attribute to a certain genre, in this project a physical simulator and an arcade are combined. Despite the fact that your main task will be to destroy the pieces of soap as precisely and quickly as possible with the help of a knife, the process itself can delay even the most sophisticated gamer. The fact is that the gameplay will allow you to cut various pieces of soap, of different structure, shape and volume, which will require agility and imagination. In other words, we have the optimal time killer, which will allow us to pass the time in line or on the way to work, and a realistic physics engine and stylish graphics will complement the picture.
