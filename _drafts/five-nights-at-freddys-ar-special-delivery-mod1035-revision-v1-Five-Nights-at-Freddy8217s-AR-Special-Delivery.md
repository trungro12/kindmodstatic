Five Nights at Freddy’s AR: Special Delivery – continuation of the popular horror series, this time the developers, preserving the original atmosphere, decided to look at the project from a slightly new side. According to the authors’ idea, the player in the course of the game subscribes to the “Fun services Fazbear” from the company Fazbear Entertainment, which allows you at your discretion to call the animatronics you like. If something goes wrong, however, the animatronics begin to hunt for their master rather than entertaining. The special atmosphere of the game will support augmented reality, as well as the presence of a cooperative mode, which only adds realism.
