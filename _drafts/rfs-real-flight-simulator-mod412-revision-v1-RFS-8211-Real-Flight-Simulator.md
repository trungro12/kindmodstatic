RFS – Real Flight Simulator – realistic simulator of control of various types of aircraft, while depending on the type of aircraft you have to perform specific tasks. A wide selection of equipment from small single-engine aircraft and passenger airliners to huge transport models will require detailed flight planning from you, because the developers have paid great attention to realism. This applies not only to the realistic physics engine, detailed aircraft models and detailed airports, but also to the fully simulated flight control process, from planning a route to complete in-flight control.
