No One Escape (MOD, Unlimited Money) – horror in which the events unfold on some abandoned base, which is literally crammed with traps, but that’s not all, a maniac killer wanders in dark labyrinths and gloomy rooms. You have to assemble a team of survivors, developing team tactics to try to survive, although someone will still have to be sacrificed. Gameplay combining elements of tactics and dynamics, as well as atmospheric graphics will appeal to all fans of horror stories.
