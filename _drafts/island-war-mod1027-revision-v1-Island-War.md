Island War (MOD, Easy Win) â€“ a real-time strategy with elements of economic simulation that will tell us the story of courageous settlers who are exploring new lands, and you, of course, are given the leading role. And so, being on the expanses of the island you need to capture it, after which you can extract resources and explore the game world, but also try to gain access to the main value of gold and precious stones. It is worth noting that the game world is not limited to one island and you making raids will be able to inhabit the surrounding islands.
