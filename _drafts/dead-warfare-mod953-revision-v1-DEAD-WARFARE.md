DEAD WARFARE: RPG Zombie Shooting (MOD, Ammo/Health) â€“ on the street in 2072, the earth is buried in the radiation and, of course, in the living dead that flooded the cities and villages. You play for one of the few survivors, and your main tasks will be that you would not be eaten or robbed by other players. Take your weapons and start your thorny path, find the survivors and join them, create alliances and get acquainted with new friends. Go to the surface and look for supplies and valuable resources that will help you survive.
