Evertech Sandbox â€“ built on the laws of physics, it is worth noting that the developers used game mechanics to create complex mechanisms, machines and structures without special skills and knowledge. And so, the creators of Evertech Sandbox gave such elements as an engine, wheels, engineering units, moving elements the look of blocks, which allows you to assemble objects such as an elevator, a car and even a helicopter simply by combining the necessary nodes. Of course, you can test your creation in the conditions of the game world. You can also share the results of your work with other people on social networks.
