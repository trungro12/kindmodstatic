Ground Driller (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ original look at the popular arcade game Digger. In this project, you still have to explore the bowels of the earth while extracting a number of minerals, such as uranium, nickel, copper, coal, iron ore and others. However, unlike the original, the whole process is performed automatically, you only need to hire workers, improve equipment and organize the workflow. Modern graphics and well-developed economic model allow you to look at the retro hit from the other side.
