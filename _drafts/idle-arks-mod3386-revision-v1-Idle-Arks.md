Idle Arks: Build at Sea (MOD, Unlimited Money/Resources) – there was a huge flood, all cities and countries were flooded and you’ll have to save the whole world! A cube-style survival simulator in which you will sail a wooden ship in search of resources for survival. Firewood, plastic bottles and chests will pass by and collect them so you can expand your ship to the size of an entire island. Idle Arks has a change of day and night as well as weather, snow and thunder.
