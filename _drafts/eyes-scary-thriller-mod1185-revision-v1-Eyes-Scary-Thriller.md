Eyes: Scary Thriller – Creepy Horror (MOD, Unlocked) – a classic horror quest in which you have to play the role of a hero named Charlie, who was trapped in an abandoned hospital, while the old building was fairly populated with ghosts, monsters, monsters and other evil spirits. Using any tactical moves, your task is to get free. Separately it is worth noting the graphics and soundtracks that in the complex perfectly convey the overall atmosphere of the game.
