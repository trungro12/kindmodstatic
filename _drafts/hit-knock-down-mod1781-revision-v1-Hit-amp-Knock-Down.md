Hit &amp; Knock Down (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ another version of the popular arcade game in which your task is to try to knock down a figure made up of cans with a ball throw, and if at the first levels the figures are simple enough, then as you go through the location various objects will appear that will hinder you in achieving the goal. In addition, you will have the opportunity to test their strength in several modes, including multiplayer.
