ZOOM Cloud Meetings – mobile multiplatform application that will allow users to organize and conduct a video conference or broadcast, which in conditions of mass self-isolation is especially relevant, while the program supports all popular messengers and social networks. Opportunities for communication and communication is not the full functionality of this site, you will also be able to plan the work, exchange information and much more. It should be noted that the video quality will only be limited by the capabilities of your device, and a simple and intuitive interface with a full set of “hot” keyboard shortcuts will make working with ZOOM Cloud Meetings much easier.
