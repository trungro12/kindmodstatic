Virtual Families 2 (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ a series of virtual simulators that combines a number of gaming directions, so you have to create a full-fledged family, build a house, equip it and even have pets, but unlike many analogs, the main characters in the game are small children. Virtual Families 2 is the second part of the series in which you have to create a virtual family and create comfortable conditions for their living, while of course the main focus should be placed on the needs and interests of the youngest participants in the game.
