Dumb Ways To Draw (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ a puzzle that originates from the moment the world saw a video clip of social advertising telling about the behavior on the railway. The video got such popularity that it was decided to release a game with already familiar characters. And so, your task with the help of swipes and lines is to lead the characters to a given point while trying to prevent the death of the heroes. The game has realistic graphics, lots of levels and hundreds of puzzles.
