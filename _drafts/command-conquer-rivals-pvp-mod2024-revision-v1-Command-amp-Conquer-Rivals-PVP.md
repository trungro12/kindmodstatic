Command &amp; Conquer: Rivals PVP â€“ android version of the cult real-time strategy, which won just stunning popularity in its time, and now the creators of Command &amp; Conquer decided to give the game a second life and release a full-fledged clone as part of mobile platforms. It is worth noting that the android version is focused on touch screens and system requirements of mobile devices, otherwise the developers tried to accurately convey the atmosphere of the very Command &amp; Conquer. And so, we have a game that will please all fans of retro projects and just lovers of classic RTS. Graphically, Command &amp; Conquer: Rivals also raises no objections.
