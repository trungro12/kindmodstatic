No Way To Die (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ a classic survival simulator where you have to try to survive in the woods. It should be noted that this project is focused on the gameplay, the plot is only superficial. And so, as in most games of this kind you are alone in the unexplored area, and then you have to extract resources, food, craft weapons and tools, as well as build a home to escape the cold and wild animals. Huge selection of items, the widest system of craft, a fully interactive open world and realistic graphics will give the gameplay maximum realism.
