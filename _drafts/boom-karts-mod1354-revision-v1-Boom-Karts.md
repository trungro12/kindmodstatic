Boom Karts (MOD, Unlocked Cars) â€“ arcade mini-races in a circle, which are distinguished by dynamics, realistic physics and excellent graphics. As it is not difficult to guess, your main task is to come to the finish line first, while on the track you are free to do whatever you want, cut, push, overtake, nothing limits you in terms of running the race. In addition, it is worth noting dozens of handmade tracks and original cars, as well as real-time multiplayer.
