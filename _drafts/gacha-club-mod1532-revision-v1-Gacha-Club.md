Gacha Club (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ casual arcade with elements of creativity made in anime style. First you have to create a character using thousands of dresses, outfits and accessories. Then, once on the dance floor, create different scenes, combinations, arm the heroes and a couple of test battles to train. Completing the process of preparation you can start real battles, a wide range of combat modes and a few dozen mini-games will noticeably diversify the gameplay.
