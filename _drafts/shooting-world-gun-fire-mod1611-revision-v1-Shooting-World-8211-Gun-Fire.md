Shooting World – Gun Fire (MOD, Unlimited Coins) – the first-person shooting gallery of which the creators decided to use classical mechanics relegated to you the role of sniper, while despite the fact that this direction is presented on mobile platforms quite widely, this project deserves attention in a number of parameters. And so, you have to conduct aimed fire at various targets, from ordinary bottles and targets, to combat drones. A wide choice of weapons with different properties will require a certain skill from you, and excellent stylized graphics and realistic physics will only add interest to the process.
