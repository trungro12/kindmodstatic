Hunter Assassin 2 (MOD, Unlimited Money) – the sequel to the 2D shooter with a top view. As soon as you start the game, you will be sent on a special mission, to clear a house of enemies. The developers added a huge arsenal of weapons to the new part, as well as various bombings from helicopters or a tank. Game controls remain unchanged, use tap to move around the map hiding from enemies, once you’re ready to attack, attack enemies from the back, which will give you a huge advantage.
