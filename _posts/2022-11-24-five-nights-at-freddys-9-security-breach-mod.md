Five Nights at Freddy’s 9: Security Breach – the sequel to the famous horror game FNaF. This time you stay locked up overnight in Freddy Fazbear’s mega pizzaplex and need to protect Gregory by all means from dangerous animatronics. Connect to surveillance cameras to keep an eye on the entire building and make a safe route through dangerous areas. Use traps to create false noise, find places to hide from dangerous opponents, and slip away at the first suspicion when you are spotted.
