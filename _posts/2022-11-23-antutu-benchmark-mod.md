AnTuTu Benchmark â€“ an application for testing your android device, which will allow you to assess the power and performance of the device, while it is worth noting that the testing algorithm implemented in this program will give you the opportunity to get the most accurate and complete data. The support of the Russian language and the almost fully automated testing process will not require any additional knowledge and skills from you.
