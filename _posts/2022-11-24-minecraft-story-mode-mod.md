Minecraft: Story Mode (MOD, Unlocked) â€“ an adventure game based on the legendary Minecraft sandbox, while the creators of Minecraft: Story Mode created a storyline from almost nothing. And so, you have to choose one of the available heroes to go on a dangerous journey and try to find the stolen Order of the Stone, while it is worth noting that the whole game is divided into episodes and we only have the first part, the storyline in turn is built according to a non-linear principle and each action will influence further developments. Visually, the game is designed in the style of a famous progenitor.
