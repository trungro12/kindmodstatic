ID Please – Club Simulation (MOD, Unlimited Money) – arcade clicker with elements of a simulator and an action arcade game in which you have to try your hand at the role of a night club bouncer. Unlike similar counterparts, you have to make timely and correct decisions, evaluating who to skip to the institution and who not. Thus, the gameplay combines casual management and an arcade element, while attention will play an important role, because in addition to appearance, you will have to make sure that visitors do not get into the club until the age of 21. Funny hand-drawn graphics are perfectly combined with the overall flow of gameplay.
