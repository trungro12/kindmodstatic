But to shoot enemies with bursts does not work out, each shot needs to be planned and thought out, because the amount of ammunition is limited and the development of events will depend on each click on the trigger. In addition to the story missions, you will have the opportunity to test your strength against the same spies as you, which will add tension to the gameplay.
