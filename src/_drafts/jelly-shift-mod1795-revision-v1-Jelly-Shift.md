Jelly Shift (MOD, Unlimited Gems) â€“ original casual arcade with elements of the runner whose creators presented classical mechanics in a completely new form. And so, your task will be to try to make the maximum distance, however, you will have to manage a geometric object that consists of a gel. On your way every now and then there will appear obstacles in the form of gates, you also need to give the object a shape to pass through the obstacle. This approach will require attentiveness and speed of reaction. Elements of physics and nice graphics perfectly complement the picture of the game.
