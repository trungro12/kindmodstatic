Where’s My Water? 2 (MOD, Unlimited Power-Ups) – a very interesting table puzzle in which you will hold water for your green pet, have time to sleep. Collect all ducks at the level and collect a large number of points. The whole point of the game is to have time for a small amount of time to draw pipes to our hero with warm water. Helping you in this will be Ellie and Krenki, who will tell you what to do in difficult situations.
