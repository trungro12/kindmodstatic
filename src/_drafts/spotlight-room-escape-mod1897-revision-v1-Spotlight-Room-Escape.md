Spotlight: Room Escape (MOD, Hints/Unlocked) â€“ adventure quest from a series of escape from the room. The plot of the game is quite typical for this genre, you wake up in an unfamiliar room, without remembering anything at all, including how you got here and now your only task will be to try to get out. It is worth noting a detailed study of the locations, a huge selection of various items located in the room that you will use to solve intricate puzzles. Do not forget that time is limited and you have to get out in just 10 minutes.
