Tanks 1990 (MOD, Unlimited Coins) – android version of the legendary arcade action Tanchiki, with which gamers of our country met with the advent of our game console Dandy. In general, this project is a full-fledged port, while the developers have tried to preserve not only the mechanics, the graphic solution, but also the atmosphere of the original game. As a bonus, the creators of Tanchiki 1990 – dandy tanks added all bonus levels, including Christmas, as well as a game mode for two.
