Castle Wreck (MOD, Unlocked) â€“ a killer with action elements in which you have to destroy enemy castles by means of artillery. Of course, the game mechanics of Castle Wreck are far from new, but the overall performance will allow you not only to pass the time, but also to stretch your brains. Stylish minimalist graphics and a wide selection of levels will significantly expand the game content. The ability to develop and upgrade will allow you to implement tactical skills.
