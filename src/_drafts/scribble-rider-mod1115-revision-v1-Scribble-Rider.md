Scribble Rider! (MOD, Unlimited Coins) – action race with Draw Climber game mechanics. You have to draw the shape of the wheel, it must be better than your opponent’s, so you can reach the finish line faster. Each location is a multiple combination of thresholds, cliffs and springboards. At first glance the gameplay will seem to be rarely difficult, but as you acquire the skill you will be able to better select the pattern for overcoming obstacles.
