Bridge Construction Simulator (MOD, Unlimited Hints) â€“ a popular game in which you will find yourself in the role of an engineer who needs to build bridges. At first, your tasks will be fairly simple, but playing a little you will understand that this is far from the case. The game has several game modes, the arcade is easier to learn and with simple tasks, and realistic, which will require you to have special patience and attention, because the design will be more difficult and more difficult with each level. Especially the developers paid attention to physics, because everything is laid on it.
