DOOM â€“ a cult first-person shooter first released on PC in 1993 and in honor of the 25th anniversary of the game Bethesda studio released a re-release for mobile platforms, while the port is made in the original graphic solution and contains the full version of the original game, as well as the addition of Thy Flesh Consumed . It is worth noting that the creators of the mobile version tried to optimize the control for touch screens as much as possible. This release will be a real gift for all fans of old-school action games, and for younger players it will allow you to touch the classics.
