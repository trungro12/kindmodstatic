Sand Balls (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ an arcade game with puzzle elements whose gameplay is based on the laws of physics. And so, at each level, your task will be to try to bring as many balls to the finish line as possible, which is not easy to do, because in addition to having to make your own path, use your finger to make passages and tunnels, and just one mistake can deprive you a significant part of the balls, so still the whole location is crammed with obstacles. The main advantage of the Sand Balls mod apk is that passing levels you will need to not only smash your head paving the optimal path, but also to show skill breaking through the passages.
