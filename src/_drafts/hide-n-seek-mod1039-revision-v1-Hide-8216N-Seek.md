Hide ‘N Seek! (MOD, Unlimited Coins) – an unusual and original game based on a thousand-year-old mechanics passing through mazes. It is worth noting that in this project you will have the opportunity to independently adjust the maze, and then, after hiding, try to stay in the shade as long as possible. In this case, you will have the opportunity not only to speak from the side of the runaway, but you can also try to find the hidden opponent. Stylish graphics in a minimalist style will allow you to maximize your focus on the gameplay, because the task expects you to be difficult.
