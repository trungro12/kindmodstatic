TerraGenesis: Landfall (MOD, Unlimited Money) – is a new and exciting city-building simulator in space. Your main objective will be to set up an autonomous base on Mars. Fleeing danger on Earth, humanity has decided to leave the planet in search of a safe haven. Mars has been chosen as a future planetary colonisation mission. Once you’ve landed, you can begin to build a future city made up of life-sustaining modules. Expand your territory by joining new clusters into a single independent base.
