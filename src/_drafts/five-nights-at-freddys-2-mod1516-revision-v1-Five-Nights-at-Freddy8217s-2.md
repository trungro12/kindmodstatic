Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 (MOD, Unlocked) – a strategy in which you have to spend in a closed museum for five nights in a row. You will play the watchman, who monitors what is happening with the help of cameras. But at night the inexplicable starts to happen, the cameras will turn off themselves, all the exhibits will come to life and you will need to go out and repair the broken cameras. You must endure all the tricks and traps of the exhibits. After all, if you hold out for 5 days you will win the game.
