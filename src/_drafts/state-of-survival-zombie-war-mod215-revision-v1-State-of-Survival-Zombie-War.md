State of Survival: Zombie War â€“ is a multiplayer online strategy whose events unfold after 6 months during which a deadly infection was destroying the civilization. Most of the population was infected and the government and military fled in an unknown direction, and the abandoned territories were under the control of the infected. The few survivors are forced to survive in such harsh conditions, while building shelters, exploring the surrounding world and destroying monsters. In addition you will have the opportunity not only to communicate with other players and unite in alliances, but also to make rescue raids in which you can find unique items and bonuses.
