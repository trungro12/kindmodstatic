Spiral Roll (MOD, Unlimited Coins) – a hypercasual arcade game in which you have to use a scraper to scrape spirals out of wood, metal or gold. But it’s not all that easy, on your way there will be unexpected obstacles that you have to get around in time. The more spirals you have, the more points you can earn per level. Also at the end of any level you’ll get a nice bonus with coin multiplication.
