The Elder Scrolls: Blades – every gamer is familiar with such a studio by the developer Bethesda who released a huge number of top games, for example, the legendary Skyrim and believe me, I didn’t focus on this role because you’re talking about a large-scale role-playing project called The Elder Scrolls: Blades, whose developer became the imperishable Bethesda. This game is a first-person role-playing game in which you have to travel around the open world, while completing tasks, fighting, collecting items, weapons, armor and other loot. In addition, you will have the opportunity to build your own castle and completely establish life there. Stunning graphics and gameplay that is not inferior to full-fledged projects from the PC.
