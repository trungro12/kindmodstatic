Ocean Survival (MOD, Unlimited Coins) – a very realistic simulation about survival in the ocean. You will have access to a small raft and a hook to mine new resources and expand your raft, use the hook to catch wooden crates that float on the water. If you’ve already gathered enough resources, you will be able to craft and build new floors and a sail for your ship. Also, do not forget about the wild animals that will attack at the first opportunity, to avoid it, look for weapons and equipment, so you can fight off any enemy. The game features weather changes, day and night changes, which will add even more realism.
