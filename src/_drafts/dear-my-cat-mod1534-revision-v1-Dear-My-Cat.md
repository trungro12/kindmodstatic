Dear My Cat (MOD, Unlimited Coins) â€“ a funny entertaining project for mobile platforms the creators of which have used rather daring solution and have presented a number of popular digital characters in the image of cats. In turn the gameplay is made in the form of a mix of a farm, a construction simulator and a quest. How not difficult it is to guess all the events unfolding in a world in which the fluffy rule, and you have to not only take care of their wards, develop the village, but also to perform various tasks, missions and so on. Colorful painted graphics, funny characters and almost complete freedom of action will certainly attract not only fans of the genre, but also fans of the tails.
