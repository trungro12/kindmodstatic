Knock’em All (MOD, Unlocked) – dynamic three-dimensional time-killer with elements of action and parkour. And so, your task will be to jump from building to building to shoot mannequins at the same time for each shot you will have only a couple of seconds. As you progress, the difficulty will constantly increase due to the appearance of additional objects and elements on locations, as well as an increase in the number of targets. A realistic physical model and minimalistic graphics, sustained in a three-dimensional style will give the gameplay a special charm.
