Cargo Transport Simulator (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ a car simulator in which you have to get behind the wheel of one of the available trucks and try to deliver the goods to a given point in time or get to a certain place. At the same time, the developers paid great attention to realism, so you will have a wide choice of actually existing trucks with traced cabs, a dynamic model of changing weather and time of day, real coverage is expensive, an elaborate physical model and excellent graphics and sound.
