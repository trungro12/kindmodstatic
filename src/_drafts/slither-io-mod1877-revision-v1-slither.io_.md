slither.io â€“ a very popular worldwide board game with puzzle elements in which you will control a small worm. The essence of the game is very simple and clear from the first minutes of the gameplay. You have to grow, everything depends on you so skillfully eat multi-colored dots that are scattered throughout the map, the more you eat them, the more in size you can grow, become huge and start hunting for people like you, do so opponents would crash into you and thereby lose all points. The game is very interesting and addictive, I strongly recommend it to all arcade fans to play!
