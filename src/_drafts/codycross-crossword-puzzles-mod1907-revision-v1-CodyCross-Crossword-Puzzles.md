CodyCross: Crossword Puzzles (MOD, Unlimited Hints) â€“ a puzzle with words the creators of which took as a basis the mechanics of crosswords, while completing it in an unusual way. In addition, the developers were not too lazy and put the gameplay on the storyline that will tell us about the friendly and inquisitive alien who crashed on our planet, but you have to solve text puzzles moving in space and time to help the protagonist learn as much as possible about our planet. Each of the levels is a whole story with its own world, heroes and events.
