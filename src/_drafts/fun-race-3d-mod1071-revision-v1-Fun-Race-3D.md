Fun Race 3D (MOD, Skins Unlocked) â€“ dynamic and original three-dimensional runner with elements of parkour in which you have to overcome the maximum possible distance, while not forgetting to make intricate somersaults and tricks, as well as avoiding collisions with obstacles. Despite the fact that the developers have chosen a minimalist graphic style, this solution does not spoil the gameplay, because the various gameplay mechanics can capture even the most demanding players. In addition, as you gain experience, you will be able to open new characters or to make collective races.
