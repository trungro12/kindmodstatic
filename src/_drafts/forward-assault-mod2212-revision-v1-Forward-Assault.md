Forward Assault (MOD, Enemy on Minimap) â€“ tactical multiplayer online shooter developers who used to create the project all the familiar elements and modules, so that fans of the genre will be able to play the familiar shooter only on mobile platforms. Habitual weapons, missions, tasks and modes also will not be a surprise, but the graphic part will greatly please fans from the first person online. But the plot submission to each player is better to consider closer on their own.
