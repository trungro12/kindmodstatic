Ice Scream 4: Rod’s Factory (MOD, Lives/Ammo) – a fascinating horror arcade game with quest and stealth elements that unfolds in a certain fictional city, which once looked into a creepy ice cream seller and took advantage of the credulity of your friend to kidnap him. Now you need to get into the factory and not only free your comrade, but also try to unravel the terrifying secret. An unusual approach to the presentation of the game, original controls and a chilling plot will appeal to all fans of horror films and stealth adventurers.
