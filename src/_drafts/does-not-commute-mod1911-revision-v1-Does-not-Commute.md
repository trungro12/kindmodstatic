Does not Commute (MOD, Time/Premium) â€“ a rather unusual racing game with original gameplay mechanics. And so, the action of the game develops in a certain city, in which, according to rumors, a scientific experiment was conducted with time and now all events repeat themselves with a certain frequency. Your task is to lay the transport routes in such a way so that each subsequent stage will have the opportunity to reach the goal and not collide with the cars that have already passed through these streets. Such gameplay will require a serious assessment of the situation and planning from you.
