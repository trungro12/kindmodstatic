Factory Inc. (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ an economic strategy with elements of a clicker and a simulator in which you play the role of an industrial complex manager, producing more than 90 different goods, ranging from smartphones to cars. As in all such games, your main task will be to accumulate the maximum amount of funds, but this will have to be spent on upgrading and expansion, so the balance in the use of income will require thoughtful decisions.
