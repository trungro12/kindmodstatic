Potion Punch (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ a fun arcade game with elements of an economic simulator in which you have to take under your control a cafe of magic drinks. In general, the gameplay is made in the usual style, combine the ingredients, create new types of magic and magic drinks and cocktails, invent new recipes and try to surprise visitors. Despite the fact that, in general, the gameplay is quite simple, the game delays for long hours and a nice drawn graphics, fairy tale plot and a huge selection of various recipes play a significant role in this.
