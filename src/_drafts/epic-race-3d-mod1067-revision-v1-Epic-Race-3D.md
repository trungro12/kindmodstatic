Epic Race 3D (MOD, Skins Unlocked) â€“ dynamic arcade game with elements of physics whose gameplay is a combination of a runner and a parkour simulator. And so, you have to go through dozens of man-made tracks developed using well-known sports modules and elements, such as nodes and obstacles invented by the creators of the project. Such a combination will add unusualness and a certain complexity to the track and, most importantly, diversify the gameplay. It is worth noting that for the successful passage you will have to work out because each level is a real survival band, however, a conveniently located camera and three-dimensional graphics will help in passing.
