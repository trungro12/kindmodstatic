Sharpen Blade (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ an original simulator with clicker elements in which you have to test yourself as the owner of the forge. Unlike many analogues in this project, you have to start almost from scratch. Having obtained the necessary amount of resources, having forged a sword, you will have to test it for strength, chopping up all kinds of culinary products, boards, blocks, stones and even engineering structures. In addition to this, there is a random mode in the game in which you will get a chance to test the cold weapons created by AI for strength.
