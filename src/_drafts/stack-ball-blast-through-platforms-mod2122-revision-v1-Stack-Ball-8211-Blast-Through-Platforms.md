Stack Ball – Blast Through Platforms (MOD, Unlocked) – arcade time killer with elements of action in which you have to destroy horizontal platforms with the help of a ball, while it is worth noting that platforms with different properties will fall on your way, some of them are destroyed without problems, others are not damaged, so you have to choose the right one ball trajectory. At first glance, the gameplay looks quite rustic, but the dynamics and bright animation will complete the picture.
