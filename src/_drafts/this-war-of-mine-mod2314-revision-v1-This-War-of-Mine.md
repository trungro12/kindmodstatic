This War of Mine (MOD, Unlocked) â€“ very interesting and intriguing with the first minutes of the game, the story that unfolds in the city in which there is already quite a long time war. But you will play an ordinary man who is trying to survive, hide in the floor of the destroyed houses, looking for food and survival, to repel the attacks of robbers. The game will show you a very different side of the war, so what it really is, do everything that your group of people only alive, take a very complex task remains, from which will depend on ending the game.
