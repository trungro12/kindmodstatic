Human: Fall Flat â€“ physical puzzle with elements of parkour in which you have to overcome intricate locations, while it is worth noting that your character is a jelly-like creature, which, moreover, is not firmly on its feet, so the usual approach to passing the level does not fit. In order to get to the goal will have to connect creativity, imagination and ingenuity and find a non-standard way of solving. In addition, you can pass levels in a cooperative mode, in a company of up to 4 people, which will further diversify the gameplay.
