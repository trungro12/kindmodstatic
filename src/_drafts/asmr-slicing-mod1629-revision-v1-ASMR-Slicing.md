ASMR Slicing (MOD, Unlimited Coins) – the next implementation of the popular physical arcade known under the simplified name “cutting” in which you have to use various cold weapons, from penknives, to swords and axes, to turn all possible objects into sawdust. At the same time, the creators tried to cover a fairly wide area, for example, you can chop a piece of ballistic gel or cut into a straw a confectionery product, and if you want to turn a metal profile into even sections using a chainsaw.
