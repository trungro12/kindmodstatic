Tiny Archers (MOD, Unlimited Money) â€“ protect your big kingdom, from evil trolls and goblins, who routinely raid your territory, attacking and burning everything along the way. Prove that people are not the last link, gather your mighty army and give a worthy rebuff to the enemies who have surrendered to you in possession. Shoot from the bow on approaching enemies, and do not let them reach the walls of the castle. The game will surprise you with nice graphics and realistic physics, as well as a large number of tasks that only a real hero can cope with!
