Coin Master â€“ a rather unusual game project whose main task can be easily understood from the name, but it is necessary to try to earn as much money as possible, coins and other material values, which later you can spend on the development, expansion and construction of your Viking village. At the same time, you can earn the money you want, for example, traveling in time and robbing caravans, you can also go selling goods in a more legitimate way, or you can simply rotate the wheel of fortune. At the same time, such simple game elements are combined into combined gameplay.
