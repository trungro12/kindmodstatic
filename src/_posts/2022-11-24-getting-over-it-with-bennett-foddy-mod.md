Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy – a rather unusual simulator game with elements of physics in which your main task will simply be to climb to the top of the mountain, while you will have complete freedom of action, however it will be extremely difficult to do this, because half of your hero’s body is in a cast-iron tub, and you will have to move around using a pickaxe, and the path is a pile of stones, boulders and rock fragments. When you can still be on top of the mountain you will receive not only a reward, but also answers to questions hidden by the authors.
